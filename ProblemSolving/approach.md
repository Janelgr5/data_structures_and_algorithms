### Problem Solving

Resource: How to Solve It by George Polya

## What is an Algorithm?

1. Algorithm: a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
2. almost everything you do in programming involes some kind of algorith
3. Foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer

## How to improve?

1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. master common problem solving patterns

### Problem Solving

1. Understand the problem
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look back and refactor

## Step 1: Understand the Problem (R)

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs?
3. What are the outputs?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (do you have enough info to solve the problem?)
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Step 2: Concrete Examples (E)

1.  help you understand the problem better
2.  provide checks that your eventual solution works how it should.
3.  learn more information
4.  Write examples with inputs and outputs:
    1.  simple examples
    2.  complex examples
    3.  empty inputs
    4.  invalid inputs

## Step 3: Break it Down (A)

1. Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.
   1. forces you to think about hte code you'll have to write before you write
   2. helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about the details (ie. sytanx)
2. Start with the skeleton of the function
3. put //comments about the BASIC steps inside the function block
   4.fill in the rest as you review your examples
