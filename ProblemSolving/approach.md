### Problem Solving

Resource: How to Solve It by George Polya

## What is an Algorithm?

1. Algorithm: a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
2. almost everything you do in programming involes some kind of algorith
3. Foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer

## How to improve?

1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. master common problem solving patterns

### Problem Solving

1. Understand the problem
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look back and refactor

## Step 1: Understand the Problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs?
3. What are the outputs?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (do you have enough info to solve the problem?)
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Step 2: Concrete Examples
